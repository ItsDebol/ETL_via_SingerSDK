# tap-jsonplaceholder

`tap-jsonplaceholder` is a Singer tap for extracting data from the JSONPlaceholder API with built-in data validation.

Built with the [Singer SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com).

## Features

- Extracts data from JSONPlaceholder API endpoints:
  - Users
  - Posts
  - Comments
- Built-in data validation for each stream
- Filtering capabilities (e.g., even-numbered IDs for posts)
- Validation error tracking and reporting
- Configurable validation rules


## Key Assumptions

### Data Structure Assumptions
- JSON responses follow consistent schema across API calls
- User IDs are unique positive integers
- Email addresses follow standard format
- Post IDs and Comment IDs are sequential integers
- All text fields (title, body) contain UTF-8 encoded content
- Timestamps not provided by API

### Validation Assumptions
- User records require valid email format
- Post titles should not be all uppercase
- Post body length minimum of 10 characters
- Comment body length minimum of 10 characters
- Address fields are required for user records
- All IDs must be positive integers
- Parent-child relationships must be maintained (comments -> posts)

### Processing Assumptions
- API rate limits not enforced
- No authentication required
- API endpoints are always available
- Data is read-only (no PUT/POST/DELETE operations)
- Network connectivity is stable
- Response times are reasonable (<30s)
- Data volume is manageable in memory

### Business Logic Assumptions
- Comments are filtered based on even-numbered post IDs
- All users are processed regardless of ID
- No specific order of processing required
- delta/incremental updates are needed for automating teh flow of data
